The logistic map is a simple nonlinear recurrence that can model population growth with limited resources.
Despite its short formula, it displays a surprisingly rich set of behaviors — from stability to periodic cycles and full chaos.
Behavior as r Changes
For small values of r, the sequence settles into a stable fixed point.
As r increases, the system undergoes period-doubling:
period-2
period-4
period-8
… and so on
This sequence of doublings builds up to the onset of chaos, where tiny changes in the initial value produce dramatically different outcomes.
Feigenbaum Constant
The spacing between successive period-doubling points shrinks by a universal factor:
δ
≈
4.669201609
…
δ≈4.669201609…
This value — the Feigenbaum constant — is found in nearly all one-dimensional maps that transition to chaos through period-doubling, making it a fundamental constant of nonlinear dynamics.
Why It Matters
The logistic map serves as one of the simplest and most famous examples of how complex and chaotic behavior can emerge from a basic mathematical rule.
It plays an important role in:
population biology
physics
nonlinear dynamics
chaos theory
electronic circuits
